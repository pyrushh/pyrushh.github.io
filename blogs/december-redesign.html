          i had been abandoning this website for a very long amount of time...
          i hadn't touched this code since my last blog so its a pretty long
          time
          <br />
          <br />
          i tried to make it look a lil bit better, added some more links and i also made an effort to remove any and
          all things written by AI from this site. i kinda want to make it more human.
          <br /><br />
          another reason to actually update the website is that i actually finally bought my own domain. although it's
          just an .xyz domain, i like it because it's mine now.
          i can also assure you that i will probably not touch this code till i get my .com domain
          <br />i also made the mobile design a bit appealing by centering my boxes when on mobile so its looks a bit
          better to at least my eyes.

          <br />
          <br />
          i don't have much to say here actually. i was just swooping in to tell everyone that i am still alove and i am
          actually working a job right now. that's also a reason i haven't been coding or updaing my Minecraft packs
          too. i want to but it's just too tiring and i al already tired from work.

          <br /><br />
          all i can say right now is i love everyone that reads this and if you are reading this, please please let me
          know by messaging me on literally any social media. i am on everything as pyrushh. i would love to know that i
          have become so famous that people are reading my blogs too.

          <br><br><br>
          but for now i have to day goodbye to you beautiful being reading this. i love you!
