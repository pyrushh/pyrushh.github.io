                            class="fa-solid fa-up-right-from-square fa-2xs"></i></a> is an annual live event hosted by
                    Mojang Studios. This live stream is brimming with exciting news about the future of Minecraft, as
                    well as
                    updates and tidbits about other games that Mojang is currently working on.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This year, Minecraft Live has an extra dose of excitement because, unlike last year, there are no
                    leaks floating around about the event.
                    <br><br>
                    Just like in the past three years, there will be a mob vote. Mojang will showcase three mobs, and
                    the community will
                    decide which one to vote for. At the time of writing, the mobs haven't been officially announced,
                    but there are already
                    memes circulating in the community speculating about a golem being included in the vote. For the
                    past two years, Mojang has
                    attempted to introduce a golem into the game through the mob vote, but both times they fell short.
                    The first time,
                    they proposed a copper golem, but Allay emerged as the winner in the vote, and the second time, they
                    presented a tuff golem, but the
                    Sniffre took home the victory.
                    <br>This time around, people are banding together to ensure that the golem comes out on top.

                    <br> <br>
                    Additionally, this year, there's speculation about an update for the End. Although there haven't
                    been any official indications
                    of an End update from Mojang, we remain optimistic and hopeful that the End will finally receive the
                    update it deserves.

                    <br><br>
                    Minecraft Live is scheduled for October 15th this year, so we'll have to wait and see what unfolds.
