          few weeks ago i bought myself a new phone. i had been using my old phone for about 5 years now and it was
          time to upgrade.
          so i bought myself a Samsung Galaxy A26 5G. although it is a mid-range phone, it has been working great for
          me so far.

          <br />
          i bought the phone around a month ago and using it as a full time phone, i go mostly no complaints. there
          are a few complaints i have with the phone. they are not a hug deal but they are there.
          <br /><br />
          my buggest complaint is that there is no always on display even though it hasa an amoled display.

          <br />
          this isn't a comprehensive review of the phone so i am not gonna sit here and tell you all of the specs but
          all i will say is that i am loving using this phone and will continue using it for few more years
          <br /><br />
          I dont know when will the next blog will be from me but rest assured i am still alive and doing well.
